# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Daily Attendance View
> Created: 2024-12-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a daily attendance view feature that allows ministry leaders to view and filter attendance records for specific dates, with today's date as the default. This feature will enhance the dashboard by providing detailed daily attendance insights with search and filtering capabilities.

## User Stories

### Ministry Leader Daily Review

As a ministry leader, I want to view attendance records for a specific day, so that I can quickly see which children were present and verify attendance data.

**Workflow:** The ministry leader opens the dashboard and navigates to the daily attendance view. They can select any date using a date picker (defaulting to today), view a list of all children checked in on that date, and use search/filter options to find specific children or families. The list shows child name, check-in time, guardian name, and contact details.

### Volunteer Attendance Verification

As a volunteer, I want to review the daily attendance list for my assigned age group, so that I can verify attendance records and identify any discrepancies.

**Workflow:** The volunteer accesses the daily attendance view, filters by their assigned age group, and reviews the list of children present. They can search by child name or guardian name to quickly locate specific records and verify attendance accuracy.

## Spec Scope

1. **Date Picker Component** - Calendar interface for selecting specific dates with today as default
2. **Daily Attendance List** - Display all children checked in on the selected date with key details
3. **Search and Filter Functionality** - Filter by child name, guardian name, and age group
4. **Responsive Design** - Ensure the interface works across all device sizes
5. **Loading and Error States** - Handle data loading and error scenarios gracefully

## Out of Scope

- Export functionality for daily reports (covered in Phase 1 roadmap)
- Bulk attendance operations (covered in Phase 1 roadmap)
- Real-time updates during service (future enhancement)
- Attendance history beyond the selected date
- Modification of attendance records (separate feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A new "Daily Attendance" section in the dashboard with date picker and attendance list
2. Search and filter functionality that works with existing database schema
3. Responsive design that maintains consistency with existing app styling
4. Error handling for network issues and empty state messaging
