## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Kids Attendance Tracker is a modern web application designed to solve attendance management challenges in kids ministry programs. The product serves three primary user groups: ministry leaders (dashboard analytics), volunteers (attendance management), and parents (self-service check-in). Key features include digital attendance tracking, age group management, comprehensive analytics, and multi-device accessibility.

### Context

The ministry attendance management market lacks modern, digital-first solutions. Existing options are either paper-based, spreadsheet-dependent, or lack the specific features needed for ministry contexts. The timing is right for a solution that addresses the unique needs of ministry organizations while providing the benefits of modern web technology.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Paper-based System**
   - Pros: Simple, no technology barriers, immediate implementation
   - Cons: Error-prone, time-consuming, no analytics, difficult to scale

2. **Generic Attendance Software**
   - Pros: Immediate availability, established features
   - Cons: Not ministry-specific, complex for volunteers, lacks parent engagement features

3. **Custom Spreadsheet Solution**
   - Pros: Low initial cost, familiar to users
   - Cons: Limited functionality, no real-time updates, difficult collaboration, no mobile access

### Rationale

The decision to build a custom web application was driven by the need for:
- Ministry-specific features and workflows
- Real-time data synchronization across devices
- Comprehensive analytics for ministry leaders
- Self-service capabilities for parents
- Scalability for growing ministry organizations

The choice of Next.js 15 with React 19 provides modern development capabilities, excellent performance, and strong ecosystem support. MySQL with Drizzle ORM offers reliable data storage with type safety. Kinde Auth provides secure, role-based authentication suitable for ministry contexts.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, responsive user experience across all devices
- Real-time data synchronization and analytics
- Reduced administrative workload for ministry staff
- Improved parent engagement through self-service features
- Scalable architecture for future growth

**Negative:**
- Initial development time and cost investment
- Learning curve for users transitioning from paper-based systems
- Dependency on internet connectivity for core functionality
- Ongoing maintenance and support requirements
